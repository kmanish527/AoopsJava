Observer Pattern/Publish-Subscribe

-->just define a one-to-one dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Example
-->YouTube Channel Subscription
when ever a user subscribes a particular channel then he becomes observer of that particular channel and whenever a new vedio is uploaded then the user is automatically notified

-->Notify me when ever sale takes place in flipkart
