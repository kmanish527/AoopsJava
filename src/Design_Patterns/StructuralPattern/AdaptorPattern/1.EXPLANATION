Adaptor Pattern
--> It is a simple Structural pattern which is used when we have two interface(1.Old interface 2.new interface) which are not compatible with each other, we use adaptor/wrapper to connect both of them

Real life Example
1.Imagine you have two friends, one who speaks only English and another who speaks only French. You want them to communicate with each other, but thereâ€™s a language barrier.
You act as an adapter, translating messages between them.
Your role allows the English speaker to convey messages to you, and you convert those messages into French for the other person.

2.Now lets consider a real life applied example
Imagine you have a old software which give only XML response but your new software can understand only JSON type of response and you want to integrate both the software together
so, Here we can use the Adaptor pattern which converts the XML response to JSON response

you might be thinking why can't we change old software so that it gives JSON response instead of using Adaptor
You are wrong as old software are very big and contains lots of APIs and data , changing each and evey line of old software is a headache and may also lead to errors
(XML - is a old technology and has heavy weight but JSON - is new and has light weight so it is used in new software )
